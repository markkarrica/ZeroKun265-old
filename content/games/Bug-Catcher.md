# Bug Catcher
A 2d Point and click game made in a day for the ZenoJam 5(May 2022) 

## Gameplay
The game has a built-in tutorial level, it's incredibly short anyway, but for the sake of completeness I'll add the instructions here: 
  - Press SPACE to turn off the lights and click the bugs to catch them     
  - Catching bugs will give you points and catching butterflies will remove them     
  - Turning the lights off will make the bugs nd butterflies flee.     
  - Let butterflies flee while catching the bugs, if a bug flees you lose(so don't turn off the lights while there's bugs)
  - Reach the score and win
